
  <h2>E-commerce Project Overview</h2>
  <p>This is an e-commerce application designed to integrate with the WordPress API for specific content management while the rest of the backend handles e-commerce functionality independently using custom-built services.</p>

  <h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> The backend is developed using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong> to build a REST API that manages products, orders, and customer data. The database is handled by <strong>MongoDB</strong> for storing and managing this information. The WordPress API is used solely for certain content management functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Built with <strong>EJS</strong> (Embedded JavaScript) templates for rendering dynamic content and styled with <strong>CSS3</strong> to ensure a responsive, user-friendly interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Users can browse products, add items to the cart, and complete purchases seamlessly.</li>
    <li>Admins can manage products, orders, and customer details directly through the custom backend interface, with specific content managed through the WordPress API.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The project is currently under development, with more features to be added. Below is an early design snapshot of the project structure.</p>
